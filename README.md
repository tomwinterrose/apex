## Upgrading from Legacy (1.x)

**There is no automatic migration path from legacy 1.x releases** due to significant architectural changes.

If you're upgrading from 1.x, you have two options:

1. **Start Fresh** - Archive your old database and begin with a clean setup. The app will detect your legacy database and guide you through the process, including downloading a backup of your data.

2. **Continue Using 1.x** - If you're not ready to migrate, use the archived image:
   ```yaml
   image: ghcr.io/pharaoh-labs/teamarr:1.4.9-archive
   ```
   Note: 1.x will continue to function but will not receive future updates.

## Image Tags
