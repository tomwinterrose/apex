"""Channel priority-teams queries.

A priority team floats its channels to the top of the global channel list,
ahead of all sport/league/time ordering (see ``channel_numbers.get_all_channels_sorted``).
This is purely an ordering preference and has no connection to the Teams page
or EPG generation. Identity comes from ``team_cache``; channels are matched by
``(sport, team_name)`` against ``managed_channels.home_team``/``away_team``.
