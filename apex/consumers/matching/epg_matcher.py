"""EPG program-data matching logic (epic apexv2-183.4).

Pure, dependency-light helpers that turn a Dispatcharr EPG program into an
input string for the EXISTING classify_stream -> TeamMatcher pipeline, and that
decide — from the program's categories — whether a program is worth matching.

Empirical basis (live Dispatcharr probe, 2026-06-01):
- Team names live in ``sub_title``, not ``title``. Titles are generic league
  names ("MLB Baseball", "NHL Hockey"); the matchup is in sub_title
  ("Chicago Cubs at St. Louis Cardinals"). So we match on title + sub_title.
- custom_properties.categories cleanly separate real games ("Sports event")
  from studio/talk ("Sports non-event") and replays ("Classic Sport Event").
  But categories are often absent in sloppy EPG, so they are a PRECISION signal,
  not a hard gate: when absent we fall back to the match itself (team extraction
  + event-window overlap is its own filter).
- "Classic Sport Event" co-occurs with "Sports event" on replays, so the
  classic/replay reject must take precedence over the event accept.

This module holds NO I/O and no StreamMatcher state — it is unit-testable in
isolation. Orchestration (index lookup, TeamMatcher invocation, reconciliation
with name matches, caching) lives in StreamMatcher.

    league/sport hint and strip it, so the matchup is extracted cleanly — a

    (e.g. "NHL Hockey") yields no teams and self-rejects downstream — correct.

    decorations (superscript "Live"/"New" markers). When there is no sub_title,
    a matchup carried inline in the title with a colon/dash separator ("MLB
    Baseball : Mets at Mariners") is split at that separator so the leading
