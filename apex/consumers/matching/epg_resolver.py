"""Resolve candidate streams to EPG-source program tvg_ids (epic apexv2-183).

A raw M3U stream's ``tvg_id`` (e.g. "FoxSports1.us") usually lives in a
different namespace from the EPG source's program ``tvg_id`` (e.g. "82547"), so
``/api/epg/programs/search/?tvg_id=<stream tvg_id>`` returns nothing. Programs
must be queried by the EPG-source channel id. This module bridges the two
namespaces WITHOUT requiring the stream to be pre-built into a Dispatcharr
channel, using a precedence cascade:

Precedence is by confidence, most authoritative first:

1. Direct  — the stream ``tvg_id`` already IS an EPGData ``tvg_id`` (the user's
   M3U is namespace-aligned with their EPG source). Same id, zero cost.
2. Channel — the stream is assigned to a Dispatcharr channel whose
   ``epg_data_id`` points at an EPGData row. This is a CURATED mapping (a user
   or Dispatcharr's auto-matcher explicitly linked the channel to its guide),
   so it outranks the name heuristic when both are available.
3. Name    — the stream NAME maps to exactly one EPGData ``name`` after strict
   normalization (drop quality suffixes / parentheticals / punctuation). A
   heuristic fallback for streams NOT on a channel. Skipped when ambiguous (a
   normalized name with >1 distinct tvg_id) so "ESPN" never silently resolves
   to "ESPN2".

The result maps stream ``tvg_id`` -> EPG-source ``tvg_id`` so the index can be
fetched by the resolved key yet keyed by the stream tvg_id the matcher carries.

    Precedence (most-trusted first), matching the intended resolution policy:

    1. **channel** — the stream is assigned to a Dispatcharr channel with an
       ``epg_data_id``. This is an explicit user/auto curation ("this stream IS
       this guide channel"), so it is trusted unconditionally — even if the
       linked EPG source is inactive (it simply yields no programs then).
    1b. **loopback** — the stream's URL is Dispatcharr's own channel proxy
       (``/proxy/ts/stream/<uuid>``, from a Dispatcharr-loopback M3U). The
       uuid identifies the source channel, whose EPG link carries the same
       curated trust as channel membership — and unlike membership it
       survives the loopback account's stream-id churn on refresh.
    2. **direct** — the stream ``tvg_id`` already equals an imported-EPG
       ``tvg_id`` (namespace-aligned M3U + EPG). Exact id match.
    3. **name** — the stream NAME maps to exactly one imported-EPG ``tvg_id``
       after strict normalization. Ambiguous names (>1 tvg_id) are skipped so
       "ESPN" never silently becomes "ESPN2".

    Direct + name only consider the ACTIVE imported EPG (``active_source_ids``;
    the caller passes the set of enabled EPG-source ids, excluding our own
    ``_Apex``). When ``active_source_ids`` is None, the full catalog is used
    (back-compat / unit tests). Streams left unresolved here are candidates for
    the provider-EPG (Xtream) fallback, which the caller applies afterward.

    Args:
        streams: Candidate stream dicts (need ``id``, ``name``, ``tvg_id``).
        epg_data_list: Dispatcharr EPGData rows (``id``, ``tvg_id``, ``name``,
            ``epg_source``).
        stream_channel_map: ``stream id -> channel dict`` (``epg_data_id``).
        active_source_ids: Enabled EPG-source ids for direct/name matching; None
            uses every row.

    Returns:
        (resolution, stats) where ``resolution`` is ``{stream_tvg_id:
        program_tvg_id}`` and ``stats`` counts hits per strategy plus
        ``unresolved`` and ``ambiguous_name`` for logging/observability.
