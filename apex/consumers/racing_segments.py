"""Racing session segment handling.

Expands racing events (F1, NASCAR, IndyCar, MotoGP, ...) into session-based
channels (Practice 1, Practice 2, Qualifying, Race, ...). Each matched racing
stream is expanded into one channel entry per session in `event.sessions`,
using ESPN-provided session start times for exact EPG timing — UNLESS the
stream's own name clearly names one specific session (e.g. "Free Practice
3"), in which case it's scoped to just that session instead of fanning out
across the whole weekend (see _session_category_from_stream_name).

Practice sessions are excluded from that whole-weekend fan-out (they're only
included when a stream's name specifically names one): providers frequently
don't carry a dedicated practice feed at all, and a generic linear stream
landing on a Practice channel is more likely to produce a channel with
nothing actually airing yet than a legitimate live source.

NASCAR-style single-session events (a single "race" session) degenerate to
one segment via the same code path - no special-casing required.
