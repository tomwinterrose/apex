"""Jellyfin server client for Live TV guide refresh.

Jellyfin forked from Emby in 2018 and inherited a near-identical API
surface. The only structural difference Apex cares about is the URL
prefix: Emby mounts under ``/emby/...`` while Jellyfin serves the same
endpoints at the server root. ``X-Emby-Token`` (the API-key header)
still works on Jellyfin for back-compat.

This client therefore subclasses EmbyClient and only swaps the prefix.
