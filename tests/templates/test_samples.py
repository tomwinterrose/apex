"""Template live-preview sample system: shapes, coverage guard, event selection.

Every league previews against one of three generic, FICTITIOUS shapes
("team" / "combat" / "racing") so a sample never looks like a real (and likely
wrong-league) game — epic gruy .1/.2. The template builder's live preview
resolves every variable through a precedence chain (curated SAMPLE_DATA ->
inline registry sample -> category auto-default, see
teamarr/templates/sample_data.py); because the chain always yields a value, a
newly-registered variable is auto-adopted into previews without a separate edit
here.

League -> shape resolution is data-driven: it reads each league's real
sport/provider from a freshly initialized database rather than any hardcoded
list, so the coverage tests also exercise resolve_profile_for_league() against
the live schema.
