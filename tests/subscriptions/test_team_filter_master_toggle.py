"""Tests for the team filter master toggle (settings.team_filter_enabled).

Bead `apexv2-zer`: when the global toggle is off, _get_effective_team_filter
must return no-filter regardless of group-level or global team selections.
That single chokepoint controls both the per-event filter (_filter_by_teams)
and the post-filter channel cleanup (_cleanup_team_filtered_channels), so
flipping the toggle truly disables team filtering end-to-end.
