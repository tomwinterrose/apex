"""Identically named streams must each survive matched-stream list building.

Regression for GitHub issue #264: users with multiple M3U accounts from the
same provider get identically NAMED streams with distinct stream IDs. The
matched-stream list builder keyed its stream lookup by name, collapsing all
duplicates onto one stream dict — so only one account's stream was ever
attached to the consolidated channel. Lookup must be ID-first.
