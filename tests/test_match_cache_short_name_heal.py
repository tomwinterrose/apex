"""Self-healing for stale stream_match_cache rows missing short_name.

Reproduces issue #201: a user's stream_match_cache held cached_event_data
written before short_name flowed end-to-end (Team has name='Philadelphia
Phillies' but short_name=''). Variables like {home_team_short} resolved
blank for those events.

The fix: TeamMatcher._reconstruct_event treats a row with name set but
short_name empty as stale and returns None, forcing the matcher to
re-fetch and re-cache with proper data on the next pass.
