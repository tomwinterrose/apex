Combat sports are **Event Only** - no team import available.

| League | ID | Provider | Type |

## Motorsports

{: .warning }
Motorsports are **Event Only** - no team import available.

| League | ID | Provider | Type |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| Formula 1 | `f1` | ESPN | Event |
| NASCAR Cup Series | `nascar-cup` | ESPN | Event |
| NASCAR Xfinity Series | `nascar-xfinity` | ESPN | Event |
| NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series | `nascar-truck` | ESPN | Event |
| IndyCar Series | `indycar` | ESPN | Event |
| IMSA SportsCar Championship | `imsa` | TSDB | Event |
| FIA World Endurance Championship | `wec` | TSDB **P** | Event |

Motorsports events are race weekends made up of multiple sessions (Practice,
Qualifying, Race). Each session is exposed as its own EPG program block. `f1`
is the fully verified ESPN reference league; the other ESPN-backed series are
configured against their ESPN scoreboard endpoints but session coverage may
vary by series. `imsa` and `wec` are backed by TSDB, which groups its flat
per-session events into the same multi-session shape — see the
[TSDB provider docs](providers/tsdb.md) for details and the free-tier caveat
for WEC.

MotoGP (`motogp`) is currently disabled (`leagues.enabled = 0`) because ESPN's
`racing/motogp` scoreboard endpoint returns no usable schedule or logo data.
A TSDB-backed migration (idLeague 4407), similar to the IMSA/WEC session
grouping above, is planned as a future enhancement.

|--------|-----|----------|
| Indian Premier League | `ipl` | TSDB **P** |
| Big Bash League | `bbl` | TSDB **P** |
| SA20 | `sa20` | TSDB **P** |

{: .note }
Cricket leagues are TSDB premium tier. A [premium API key](providers/tsdb.md) is required for full event coverage.

## Adding New Leagues

New leagues are added to the `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO leagues` block in `apex/database/schema.sql`. Each league requires a provider, league ID, display name, sport, and optionally logos and TSDB tier. See the [Providers](providers/) section for details on each provider's ID format.

If you need a league that isn't listed here, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomwinterrose/apex/issues).
