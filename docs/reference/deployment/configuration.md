# Configuration

Teamarr is configured via environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Most settings have sensible defaults and don't need to be changed.

## General Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TZ` | `UTC` | UI timezone for date/time display. EPG output timezone is set separately in Settings. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Console log level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | Log format: `text` or `json` (for log aggregation systems like ELK, Loki, Splunk) |
| `LOG_DIR` | auto-detected | Override log directory path. See [Log Directory Detection](#log-directory-detection). |
| `SKIP_CACHE_REFRESH` | `false` | Skip team/league cache refresh on startup. Set to `true`, `yes`, or `1`. Useful for faster restarts during development. |

## ESPN API Settings

These settings control how Teamarr communicates with ESPN's API. Most users don't need to change these defaults.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ESPN_MAX_WORKERS` | `100` | Maximum parallel workers for fetching data |
| `ESPN_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `100` | HTTP connection pool size |
| `ESPN_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Request timeout in seconds |
| `ESPN_RETRY_COUNT` | `3` | Number of retry attempts on failure |

### When to Adjust ESPN Settings

If you experience timeouts or connection failures during cache refresh or EPG generation, you may be hitting **DNS throttling** from your network setup. This commonly affects users with:

- **PiHole** or **AdGuard** DNS filtering
- Custom DNS resolvers with rate limits
- Router-level DNS throttling

**Recommended settings for DNS-throttled environments:**

```yaml
environment:
  - ESPN_MAX_WORKERS=20
  - ESPN_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20
  - ESPN_TIMEOUT=15
```

These lower values reduce the number of parallel DNS lookups, giving your DNS resolver time to process requests without throttling.

{: .note }
ESPN's API has generous rate limits that are practically impossible to hit. Connection issues are almost always caused by local DNS or network constraints, not ESPN throttling.

## MLB Stats API Settings

Controls for the MLB Stats provider (MiLB leagues).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MLBSTATS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `20` | HTTP connection pool size |
| `MLBSTATS_TIMEOUT` | `15` | Request timeout in seconds |
| `MLBSTATS_RETRY_COUNT` | `3` | Number of retry attempts on failure |

## Logging

Teamarr writes to two rotating log files:

| File | Contents | Rotation |
|------|----------|----------|
| `teamarr.log` | All log messages (DEBUG and above) | 10 MB x 5 files |
| `teamarr_errors.log` | Errors only | 10 MB x 3 files |

The console log level is controlled by the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (default: `INFO`). File logs always capture `DEBUG` regardless of this setting.

### Log Directory Detection

The log directory is determined in this order:

1. `LOG_DIR` environment variable (if set)
2. `/app/data/logs` (if `/app/data` exists — Docker default)
3. `<project_root>/logs` (local development fallback)

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Docker container stdout
docker logs --tail 100 teamarr

# Log file (inside container or data volume)
docker exec teamarr cat /app/data/logs/teamarr.log | tail -100

# Or from data volume on host
tail -n 100 ./data/logs/teamarr.log
```

## Data Paths

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `/app/data/teamarr.db` | Database — all configuration, teams, templates, history |
| `/app/data/logs/` | Log files (auto-rotating) |
| `/app/data/epg/` | Generated XMLTV output |

{: .warning }
**Never delete `teamarr.db`** — it contains all your configuration. Schema upgrades are handled automatically via migrations on startup.
