## API Request Format

All requests use the same base parameters:

```
feed=modulekit&key={client_key}&view={view}&client_code={league_code}&fmt=json&lang=en
```

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `schedule` | Full season schedule |
| `scorebar` | Live scores |
| `teamsbyseason` | Teams in league |
| `seasons` | Season metadata (playoff flag, season names, dates) |

The `provider_league_id` in `schema.sql` is the `client_code` value (e.g., `ohl`, `ahl`, `lhjmq` for QMJHL).

## Cache TTLs

| Data | TTL |
|------|-----|
| Full season schedule | 30 minutes |
| Teams | 24 hours |
| Seasons metadata | 24 hours |
| Past games | 7 days |
| Today's games | 30 minutes |
| Tomorrow's games | 4 hours |
| 3-7 days out | 8 hours |
| 8+ days out | 24 hours |

The provider fetches the full season schedule and caches it, then filters by date for individual queries. This reduces API calls significantly.

## Special Behaviors

- **Full schedule caching**: `get_team_schedule()` fetches the entire season once, then filters locally
- **Lookback**: Scans 7 days back to resolve `.last` template variables
- **QMJHL client code**: Uses `lhjmq` (French: Ligue de hockey junior majeur du Québec)
- **Thread-safe**: Connection pooling with configurable limits
- **Season type via seasons view**: HockeyTech's `schedule` feed leaves `game_type` empty for every game, but each game has a `season_id`. The separate `seasons` view is joined in to map `season_id` → canonical season_type: `playoff == "1"` → `postseason`; `season_name` containing `preseason` / `pre-season` / `exhibition` → `preseason`; anything else → `regular`. Showcase/All-Star seasons (e.g. "AHL 2026 All-Star Challenge", "OHL Top Prospects") fall into `regular` since they have no playoff flag and no preseason keyword.
