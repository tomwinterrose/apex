### Output Days Ahead

## Scheduled Generation

Enable automatic EPG generation on a schedule.

### Cron Expression

| Every 2 Hours | `0 */2 * * *` | Run every 2 hours |

| Daily at Midnight | `0 0 * * *` | Run once daily at midnight |
| Daily at 6 AM | `0 6 * * *` | Run once daily at 6 AM |

### Run Now

Manually trigger an EPG generation run.

## Scheduled Channel Reset

For users experiencing stale channel logos in Jellyfin. Schedule a periodic purge of all Apex channels before your media server's guide refresh. Leave disabled if you're not having issues.

### Enable Scheduled Channel Reset

Toggle whether to enable periodic channel reset.

### Reset Schedule (Cron Expression)

Standard cron format for scheduling the reset. Common presets are available:

| Daily 3:30 AM | `30 3 * * *` |
| Daily 4:30 AM | `30 4 * * *` |
| Daily 5:30 AM | `30 5 * * *` |

{: .note }
Set this to run shortly before your media server's scheduled guide refresh. Channels will be recreated on the next EPG generation.

## EPG Program-Data Matching

EPG program-data matching settings now live on the **Event Groups** settings tab — see [Event Group Settings → EPG Program Matching](event-groups.md#epg-program-matching). They moved there because matching is enabled per event group. The full how-it-works walkthrough is in the [EPG Program Matching guide](../epg-matching.md).
