# Templates

Templates define how your EPG content looks - the titles, descriptions, and artwork for programmes in your guide.

## What Templates Do

When Teamarr generates EPG, it uses templates to create programme entries. Templates contain:

- **Title, subtitle, and description formats** using variables like `{team_name}`, `{opponent}`, `{game_time}`
- **Filler content** for pregame, postgame, and idle periods
- **Conditional logic** to show different descriptions based on game context
- **XMLTV metadata** like categories and flags

A single template can be assigned to multiple teams or event groups.

## Template Types

### Team Templates

For **team-based EPG** where each team has a dedicated channel (e.g., "Detroit Lions", "LA Lakers").

- Channel persists 24/7
- Content shown from the team's perspective ("we play the Bears")
- Includes idle content for days without games
- Supports `.next` and `.last` suffixes to reference upcoming/previous games

### Event Templates

For **event-based EPG** where channels are created dynamically for each game.

- Channels appear around game time and disappear after
- Content is positional ("away team @ home team") rather than team-specific
- No idle content needed (no channel when no game)
- No `.next` or `.last` suffixes needed - each channel references only one event
- Used with event groups that match streams to real events

## Template Form Tabs

The template editor has five tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Basic Info** | Template name and event duration settings |
| **Defaults** | Title, subtitle, description(s), artwork URL, and channel name/logo (event templates) |
| **Conditions** | Rules that show different descriptions based on game context (team templates only) |
| **Fillers** | Pregame, postgame, and idle content with optional conditional logic |
| **Other EPG Options** | XMLTV categories, tags (new/live/date), and video quality |

## Variables

Templates use variables enclosed in curly braces that get replaced with real data:

```
{team_name} vs {opponent} at {venue}
→ "Detroit Lions vs Chicago Bears at Ford Field"
```

**Team templates** support suffixes for multi-game context:
- `{opponent}` - current game's opponent
- `{opponent.next}` - next game's opponent
- `{opponent.last}` - last game's opponent

**Event templates** don't use suffixes - each channel exists for a single event, so there's no "next" or "last" game to reference.

See [Variables](variables) for the complete list of 207 available variables. Artwork
fields support a shared [Game Thumbs](../game-thumbs) base URL so templates can store
relative image paths — see [Artwork & Game Thumbs](variables#artwork--game-thumbs).

## Filler Content

Team templates support filler programmes for non-game periods:

| Filler | When It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Pregame** | Hours before game starts (configurable) |
| **Postgame** | After game ends until midnight or next programme |
| **Idle** | Days with no games scheduled |

Each filler has its own title, subtitle, description, and artwork URL.

## Conditions

Conditions let you show different descriptions based on game context:

- Team on a win streak? Show "🔥 5-game win streak!"
- Playing at home? Show "Home game at {venue}"
- Ranked matchup? Show "Top 25 showdown"

Conditions have priorities - the first matching condition wins.

See [Conditions](conditions) for available condition types.
