## Game Thumbs Integration

These templates use Game Thumbs to generate dynamic programme artwork. Game Thumbs creates matchup images showing:

- Team logos for both teams
- Live scores during games
- Win/loss indicators for completed games
- Broadcast network badges
- Venue and time information

See [Game Thumbs](../game-thumbs) for setup instructions and hosted options.
