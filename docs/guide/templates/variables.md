# Template Variables

Templates use variables enclosed in curly braces that get replaced with real data when EPG is generated. Apex provides 207 variables across 17 categories.

## Team vs Event Templates

Variables are scoped to the template type they make sense in. The template editor's variable picker only surfaces variables that apply to the template you're editing.

- **Team templates** have an "our team" perspective — the subscribed team is the anchor. These templates expose team-perspective variables like `{team}`, `{opponent}`, `{is_home}`, `{team_record}`, `{win_streak}`, `{result}`, `{odds_moneyline}`, and similar "my team vs the other team" variables.
- **Event templates** are positional — they describe a matchup without a reference team. These templates expose positional variables like `{home_team}`, `{away_team}`, `{home_team_record}`, and game-level data. Event templates additionally expose the feed-team family (`{feed_team}`, `{feed_team_short}`, `{is_home_feed}`, etc.) for feed-separated channels.
- **Shared variables** (most of the list) are available in both — positional teams, venue, date/time, playoffs, odds (excluding the team-perspective `{odds_moneyline}` pair), soccer, combat sports, and league/sport identifiers.

If you hand-type a scope-restricted variable into a template where it doesn't belong (e.g., `{team}` in an event template), it will still resolve (backward compatibility), but the picker won't offer it. Use the picker to stay within the intended scope.

## Suffix Support

**Team templates** support suffixes to reference different games:

| Suffix | Context | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| (none) | Current game | `{opponent}` |
| `.next` | Next upcoming game | `{opponent.next}` |
| `.last` | Most recent game | `{opponent.last}` |

**Event templates** don't need suffixes - each channel exists for a single game, so there's no "next" or "last" to reference.

In the tables below, the **Suffixes** column indicates which suffixes are available:
- **base** = no suffix (current game)
- **.next** = next game
- **.last** = last game

## Artwork & Game Thumbs

Three template fields hold image URLs and accept the same variables as any other field:

| Field | Used for |
|-------|----------|
| **Program Art URL** (`program_art_url`) | the programme `<icon>` in the EPG (per-game artwork) |
| **Channel Logo URL** (`event_channel_logo_url`, event templates) | the Dispatcharr channel logo **and** the EPG channel icon |
| **Filler Art URL** (pregame/postgame/idle `art_url`) | artwork on filler programmes |

### Game-Thumbs base URL

Instead of writing the full image host in every template, set it **once** in
**EPG → Output → Game Thumbs → Game-Thumbs Base URL** (e.g. your
[Game Thumbs](../game-thumbs) host). Templates then store only the **relative path**,
always starting with `/`:

```
/{league_id}/{away_team_pascal}/{home_team_pascal}/cover.png?style=6&logo=true&fallback=true
```

At generation the base URL — host **and port**, exactly as you entered it — is prefixed onto the
relative path. Rules:

- **Relative paths** (start with `/`) get the base prefixed.
- **Absolute URLs** (anything with `http://`/`https://`) are left **unchanged**, so you can
  still hardcode a one-off full URL in a single field.
- Empty base URL = no prefixing (every art field must then be a full URL).

The same reconstructed URL is sent everywhere it's needed — the EPG `<icon>` **and** the
Dispatcharr channel logo — so the guide artwork and the channel logo always match. The
live preview in the template editor applies the base URL too, so what you see matches the
generated output (and renders the actual image so you can confirm the link resolves).

| `{vs_at}` | 'vs' if home, 'at' if away | base, .next, .last | `vs` |
| `{vs_@}` | 'vs' if home, '@' if away | base, .next, .last | `vs` |

### Feed Team

When a channel is configured for a specific home or away broadcast feed (via the Feed Separation setting), these variables resolve to the team whose feed this channel carries — independent of which team is home or away on any given day. If the channel has no feed assignment, all Feed Team variables return empty strings (they disappear gracefully from templates).

These are most useful for Event EPG templates on stream-separated channels (e.g., an MLB "Home feed" channel that always shows the home broadcaster's perspective regardless of which team is home today).

| Variable | Description | Suffixes | Sample |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| `{feed_team}` | Feed team full name | base | `Baltimore Orioles` |
| `{feed_team_short}` | Feed team short name | base | `Orioles` |
| `{feed_team_abbrev}` | Feed team abbreviation uppercase | base | `BAL` |
| `{feed_team_abbrev_lower}` | Feed team abbreviation lowercase | base | `bal` |
| `{feed_team_logo}` | Feed team logo URL | base | ESPN logo URL |
| `{is_home_feed}` | `'true'` if this channel is the home team's feed, `'false'` if away, `''` if no feed | base | `true` |
| `{is_away_feed}` | `'true'` if this channel is the away team's feed, `'false'` if home, `''` if no feed | base | `false` |
| `{feed_home_away}` | `'Home'` if home feed, `'Away'` if away feed, `''` if no feed | base | `Home` |
| `{broadcast_feed}` | `'Home Team Feed'` / `'Away Team Feed'` / `''` if no feed | base | `Home Team Feed` |
| `{broadcast_feed_team}` | `'{Team Name} Feed'` or `''` if no feed | base | `Baltimore Orioles Feed` |

Feed Team variables do **not** support `.next` / `.last` suffixes — they describe the channel's configuration, not a specific game's schedule. For per-game home/away references, use the `{home_team}` / `{away_team}` variables above.

`{broadcast_feed}` and `{broadcast_feed_team}` are **pre-formatted** — they include the literal `" Feed"` suffix. When feed separation isn't active they return `""` as a unit, so the whole phrase disappears cleanly from the template (unlike composing `{feed_home_away} Team Feed` yourself, which would leave `"Team Feed"` orphaned).

| `{early_prelims_bouts}` | Early prelims bouts only | `Mauricio Ruffy vs Jamie Mullarkey` |

{: .note }
UFC events are split into segments (Early Prelims, Prelims, Main Card). When using segment-based channel routing, each channel gets a `{card_segment}` value indicating which segment it covers. The `{fighter1}` and `{fighter2}` variables always refer to the headline (main event) bout.
