# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.

## Stream Matching

### Streams show as "Failed" after generation

Failed streams couldn't be matched to a real sporting event. Common causes:

- **Stream name too vague** — Names like "Sports 1" or "NBA 3" don't contain team names. Teamarr needs identifiable team or event information.
- **League not subscribed** — The stream's league isn't enabled in Event Groups > Global Defaults. Enable it and regenerate.
- **Team name mismatch** — Your IPTV provider uses a non-standard name. Add a [team alias](detection-library#team-aliases) to map it to the official name.
- **Date mismatch** — Streams with dates in DD/MM format may be parsed as MM/DD. Use [custom regex extractors](event-groups/creating-groups#custom-regex-extractors) with named groups (`(?P<day>...)/(?P<month>...)`) to fix this.

Click the **Failed** count in the run history to see details for each unmatched stream. Use the **Fix** button to manually match a stream to an event.

### Streams matching the wrong event

- Check the [Detection Library](detection-library) for conflicting league or sport hints
- Verify your stream filters (include/exclude regex) aren't too broad
- Use the preview button on the Event Groups page to see matches without running a full generation

## Channels

### Channels not appearing in Dispatcharr

1. Verify Dispatcharr integration is connected (Settings > Dispatcharr shows "Connected")
2. Verify an EPG source is selected
3. Run EPG generation and check if streams matched successfully
4. Check [channel lifecycle timing](settings/channels#channel-lifecycle) — channels may not be created yet based on your create timing settings

### Channels disappearing unexpectedly

- Check [delete timing](settings/channels#channel-lifecycle) — channels are deleted based on post-event buffer settings
- Review the [Recently Deleted](channels#recently-deleted) section on the Channels page
- If using "Same day" delete timing, channels are removed at midnight

### Channel numbers colliding with existing channels

Set the **Channel Range Start** in Settings > Channels to a range that doesn't overlap with your existing Dispatcharr channels. For example, if you have channels 1-500, set the start to 1000.

### Stale logos in media server

Some media servers (particularly Jellyfin) cache channel logos aggressively. Enable **Scheduled Channel Reset** in Settings > EPG to periodically purge and recreate channels before your media server's guide refresh.

## Dispatcharr Connection

### "Connection error" when testing

- Verify the URL includes the protocol (`http://` or `https://`)
- Check that Dispatcharr is running and accessible at the specified port
- If using Docker, ensure both containers are on the same network or use the correct IP/hostname
- Check for firewalls blocking the port

### EPG source dropdown is empty

You need to add Teamarr's XMLTV URL as an EPG source in Dispatcharr first. Copy the URL from the EPG page in Teamarr and add it in Dispatcharr's EPG sources.

## Generation

### Generation takes too long

- Reduce **Event Lookahead** in Settings > Event Groups (shorter window = fewer events to check)
- Reduce **Schedule Days Ahead** in Settings > Teams (fewer days = less schedule data)
- Use per-group subscription overrides to limit which leagues each group scans
- Ensure the team/league cache is fresh (Settings > System > Refresh Cache)

### Generation fails or shows errors

Check the logs for details:

```bash
# Docker
docker logs --tail 200 teamarr

# Log file (inside container or data volume)
tail -n 200 data/logs/teamarr.log
```

Common causes:
- Network timeout reaching ESPN or TSDB APIs
- Dispatcharr API returning errors (check Dispatcharr logs too)
- Database locked (shouldn't happen in normal operation — restart if it does)

## Database & Upgrades

### Startup crash after upgrade

If Teamarr fails to start after pulling a new image, check the logs for migration errors. Common fixes:

- **Never delete `teamarr.db`** — it contains all your configuration. Migrations handle schema changes automatically.
- If upgrading from a very old version (pre-2.1.2), the migration path should work automatically. If it doesn't, file a bug report with the error message.

### Restoring a backup

Go to Settings > System > Backup & Restore. Upload a `.db` backup file. A backup of your current database is created automatically before restoring. The application needs to be restarted after restore.

## Logs

Teamarr writes to two log files in the `data/logs/` directory:

| File | Contents | Rotation |
|------|----------|----------|
| `teamarr.log` | All log messages (DEBUG and above) | 10 MB x 5 files |
| `teamarr_errors.log` | Errors only | 10 MB x 3 files |

The console log level is controlled by the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (default: `INFO`). File logs always capture `DEBUG` regardless of this setting.

```bash
# View recent logs
docker logs --tail 100 teamarr          # Console output
docker exec teamarr cat data/logs/teamarr.log | tail -100  # Log file
```
