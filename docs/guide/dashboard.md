## EPG Generation History

A table showing recent EPG generation runs with:

| **Status** | Completed (✓), failed (✗), cancelled (⊘), or running (spinner) |
| **Time** | Timestamp of the run |
| **Processed** | Teams / Event Groups processed in this run |
| **Programmes** | Total programmes generated. Hover for breakdown: Events, Pregame, Postgame, Idle |
| **Matched** | Streams successfully matched to events. Click for drill-down with search/filter |
| **Failed** | Streams that could not be matched. Click to see details and use the Fix button to open the event matcher |
| **Channels** | Active channels after this run |
| **Duration** | How long the generation took |
| **Size** | XMLTV file size |

{: .tip }
Click the **Matched** or **Failed** numbers to open a drill-down modal showing individual stream details, grouped by event group. Use the search bar to filter by group name or stream.

## Getting Started Guide

When no teams or templates are configured, the dashboard displays a getting started guide with four steps:

1. **Configure Settings** - Connect to Dispatcharr, set EPG output path and timezone
2. **Create Templates** - Define title/description formats using variables
3. **Add Teams** - Import teams for team-based EPG (one XMLTV channel per team — wire it to one of your existing Dispatcharr channels)
4. **Create Event Groups** - Import stream groups from Dispatcharr for event-based EPG (Apex creates dynamic channels per matched game)

Each step links directly to the relevant page. Once you have at least one template and either teams or event groups configured, the getting started guide is replaced by the statistics quadrants and generation history.
