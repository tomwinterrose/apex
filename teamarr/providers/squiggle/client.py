"""Squiggle AFL API HTTP client.

Handles raw HTTP requests to https://api.squiggle.com.au/.
No data transformation — just fetch and return JSON.

Usage policy (from https://api.squiggle.com.au/):
- Set a descriptive UserAgent identifying the bot
- Cache and reuse data — do not spam identical requests
- Avoid large numbers of simultaneous requests

We satisfy these by:
- Setting SQUIGGLE_USER_AGENT in every request
- Caching the season schedule in-process via TTLCache
