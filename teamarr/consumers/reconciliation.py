"""Channel Reconciliation System for Event-based EPG.

Detects and resolves inconsistencies between Teamarr's managed_channels
database and Dispatcharr's actual channel state.

Issue Types:
- Orphan (Teamarr): Record exists in DB but channel missing in Dispatcharr
- Orphan (Dispatcharr): Channel with teamarr-* tvg_id exists but no DB record
- Duplicate: Multiple channels for the same event
- Drift: Channel settings differ between Teamarr and Dispatcharr

Actions:
- auto_fix: Automatically resolve issues based on settings
- detect_only: Report issues without fixing
- manual: Queue issues for user review

def detect_stale_groups(db_factory: Any) -> list[dict]:
    """Detect managed event groups whose Dispatcharr M3U source group is gone.

    A group is "stale" when it is enabled, has an ``m3u_group_id``, and that
    channel group no longer exists in Dispatcharr — i.e. the source was
    deleted/renamed. This is distinct from off-season (the group still exists
    with zero current streams): Dispatcharr channel-groups are persistent, so an
    off-season group is still returned by ``list_groups()`` and is NOT flagged.

    Side effect: refreshes ``source_last_seen`` for present sources and sets
    ``source_missing`` for missing ones. If Dispatcharr is unreachable or returns
    no groups, nothing is flagged (avoids false mass-staleness on a blip).

    Returns:
        The current list of stale groups (``get_stale_groups``).
